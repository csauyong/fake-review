    "Several machine learning algorithms are applied to classify the movie reviews into genuine reviews and fake reviews. The proposed classification algorithms include Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, KNN and K* algorithms. Using the result of classification, the confusion matrix can be drawn. We will compare the confusion and the metrics of classification result using different algorithms. Since our dataset is class-balanced, all of accuracy, precision and recall are useful metrics in evaluation. \n",

    "Comparing the performance of different supervised learning algorithms, we will apply the top-performing algorithms on real-life unlabelled reviews to evaluate whether it can identify fake movie reviews effectively."
